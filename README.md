# Random average number service

- When the random average number service starts it calls a target service using recursion every one second `https://csrng.net/csrng/csrng.php?min=0&max=100`

- The target API returns an object that contains a random number `[{ max: 100, min: 0, random: 23, status: success }]`

- This number is pushed in a number list promise

- When the random average number endpoint is called `/random-average-number` it takes the number list stored in the promise and builds a json response object

- The json response includes a list of the random numbers since the service started, a calculated average number and fixed average number `{randomNumbers:[69,19,1,55],averageNumber:36,averageNumberFixed:36}`

## How to run

1. You will need the latest LTS version of Node JS `18.17.1`
2. `npm run build`
3. `npm run start`
4. When you are ready you can go hit the service endpoint [http://localhost:8005/random-average-number](http://localhost:8005/random-average-number) `http://localhost:8005/random-average-number`
5. You should see the average random number response`{randomNumbers:[69,19,1,55],averageNumber:36,averageNumberFixed:36}`
6. If you hit the endpoint again you will see an increment in the results
